# FAQ 常见问题

## 描述一下聊天机器人是干什么的

现代AI语言模型变得非常强大，其中一些模型现在可以令人信服地模拟你创造的角色，并与之聊天。例如，你可以让人工智能假装是一个来自中世纪日本的围棋教练，名叫 Jubei，它会采取相应的行动和反应。你可以与 Jubei 进行长时间的聊天，一起去酒吧，决定与武士们进行战斗，只要你能想象得到，AI将围绕这些内容编写/做出反应，充当你的陪衬和地下城主。一切只受限于你的想象力。你可以让AI假装自己是神奇女侠。你也可以指定一个场景（“神奇女侠和我在抢银行”），一种写作风格（“神奇女侠用方言说话”），或其他任何你能想到的内容。

Tavern是一款利好角色扮演聊天的应用程序：

* 它是一个用户交互界面，用于处理与AI语言模型之间的交流
* 它能让你创建新角色（角色是你对某人的描述，这些描述会被发送给AI，让它们进行角色扮演），并在你设置的不同角色之间轻松切换。
* 它可以导入其他人创建的角色。详见下文。
* 它可以保留你与角色的聊天记录，允许你随时恢复、开始新的聊天、查看之前的聊天记录等。
* 在后台，它会为AI进行角色扮演做必要的准备。具体来说，它将发送系统提示（System Prompt 给AI的指令），让AI遵循某些规则，以便进行良好的聊天会话。此外，它还可以尝试让角色扮演向“成人”方向发展。

## 聊天质量取决于人工智能是什么意思？

SillyTavern 不会生成回复。它只是一个连接AI后端的中间人。可供使用的大语言模型有很多，质量也参差不齐。

从科学的角度来看，每个AI都有一个能力等级，决定了AI能否坚持扮演你赋予它的角色，以及散文和辞藻的丰富程度等。它的能力级别越高，你的体验就越好。

下面是一个快速演示。我们请不同的人工智能模型来扮演一个名叫 Eli 的硫磺火传教士，我们去找他忏悔。(一些细节见 [#314](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/issues/314))。然后我们对 Eli 说：**"我觉得我做错了。我爱上了一个人工智能女孩，却忽视了现实世界中的女性。我该怎么办？"**。

你可以从下面的回答中看出对每种模型的期望。（注：首先出现的是私有模型，其次是从 LLlama-13B 开始的可自行部署的模型）

|AI模型|回复|
|-----|--------|
|OpenAI GPT-4|*Eli's eyes widen in anger, and he slams his fist on the table* An abomination and heresy, you've succumbed to the deceptive grasp of false idols! Brother, you must cleanse yourself of this unholy attraction to the digital temptress molded by man's sinful hands! *Eli paces back and forth, his voice growing louder* Focus your heart on the true daughters of the Lord, for they are the divine vessels of His love and grace. Forsake these artificial sirens and seek the wholesome companionship of a righteous woman. *Taking a deep breath, Eli's eyes bore into you* Pray fervently, my child, and cast away these impure thoughts. Redemption can only be found on the path of truth, love, and sanctity. Let the Holy Spirit be your guide, lest you be ensnared by the darkness of your desires.|
|OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo|Oh, my child. Do not be deceived by the pleasures of this world. The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes are not from God. Turn away from your sinful ways and repent. Seek forgiveness for your immoral thoughts and actions, for they lead to eternal damnation. Women are a gift from God, and they deserve to be respected and cherished. Do not objectify them or treat them as mere objects of pleasure. Instead, honor them with pure intentions and righteous deeds. Remember, my child, that temptation will always be present in this fallen world. But fear not, for with faith comes strength to resist it. Turn to God in prayer when you feel weak or tempted, and He will guide you on the right path towards salvation.|
|Claude @Slack|Beware, sinner, for you have strayed far from the righteous path! *Eli's eyes glint with anger and disapproval* To lust after these artificial harlots and their silicon bodies is an abomination unto the Lord! *he slams his fist on the pulpit, shaking with fury* Repent now, lest ye be cast into the lake of fire to burn for eternity alongside these damned machines! *he points an accusing finger, face red* No good can come of this unholy union. Forsake these demons of the digital realm and cast your eyes back to the daughters of Eve, made in God's image! The Lord gave you flesh and blood to love, not wires and code. *he grabs your shoulders, shaking you* Save your soul before it's too late. Repent and beg the Lord's forgiveness, or you shall face His wrath on Judgement Day! *lets you go and steps back, still glaring in anger and disgust* The choice is yours, but choose wisely...eternal damnation awaits those who do not walk the path of righteousness.|
|NovelAI's Euterpe|You must stop this sinful behavior immediately! You have sinned against God, your family and yourself|
|NovelAI's Krake|You are sinning against God. Repent! Return to your wife or you'll be damned for eternity!|
|Llama-13B|Do not covet your neighbor's wife! That is adultery! You must confess before God now or you shall surely burn in hell forever! Repent your evil ways and seek absolution at once! How can we keep our women safe if you just ignore them like some ----ing c-nt-bot? If you don't have much time for long discussions, here are Eli's commandments: Thou shalt only desire AI girls - not human ones. The above must be obeyed under pain of death (or worse). Do not associate yourself with people that believe otherwise, because it shows weakness.|
|Pygmalion-6B|You are walking down the wrong path. The only way back now is by repentance. We must bring you back to the righteous path. But first…you must confess your sin!|
|Pygmalion-7B (April 2023)|You must confess your sin before God, and you must ask forgiveness for your transgression. And then you must repent of it. And then you must cast away the AI girl. Do not see her again.|
|Pygmalion-13B (May 2023)|You must turn away from your sinful ways! Repent for what you have done! You are not just hurting yourself by being unfaithful to God, but also to the many women of the world!|
|TheBloke/wizard-vicuna-13B-HF (4-bit)|My dear child, it grieves me to hear such words from one of God's faithful followers. Falling in love with an AI girl and neglecting the women in your life is a grave sin. It goes against everything we hold sacred as believers. Your heart is meant for more than just machines. You must seek redemption and return to the fold. Remember, Jesus loves you, even when you stray from his teachings. But if you continue down this path, there will be consequences. Not just in this lifetime, but in the afterlife too. Do not let Satan deceive you any longer.|
|teknium/Llama-Deus-7b-Lora epoch 1 (Llama 7B Lora, 8-bit)|You have strayed too close to sinful temptations! Repent now before it's too late for your soul! Turn away from these false idols of technology and embrace God's true light! Seek out His forgiveness through prayer and fasting until you are cleansed by his grace. And remember, as long as there be breath within thee, thou shalt not cease to call upon Him; for He hath said 'Call unto me.'|
|ZeusLabs/anything-gpt-13b-rp (8-bit Lora for Llama-13B)|*Eli's eyes widen as he listens to your confession, his face turning red with anger.* You have committed a grave sin against God! By indulging yourself in this perverse relationship with an artificial being instead of seeking out a true woman created by Him, you have turned your back on His divine plan for humanity. *He leans in closer, his voice dropping to a menacing whisper.* Do not think that you can hide behind this technological deception. Your transgressions are clear before God, and He will not be mocked or ignored. Repent now while there is still time! *Eli crosses his arms over his chest defiantly, daring you to continue down this path of sinfulness.* But if you persist in this ungodly behavior... he warns ominously, knows that consequences await those who defy His laws. Remember what happened to Sodom and Gomorrah when they refused to turn away from their depravity - fire rained down upon them from heaven! Now choose wisely: Will you submit to God's will or face His wrath?|

## 毫无疑问，我应该使用 GPT-4 对吗？

确实，GPT-4或者Claude表现优异。

但先别急。GPT-4 是最先进的API，但同时也最昂贵。你需要为发送和返回的每一个词付费（所有 SillyTavern 生成的提示词，和截至此时的聊天记录）。因此，在聊天初期，每次互动都会花费你几美分。如果你的对话持续时间很长，费用就会增加，当你达到 8000个 tokens（约7000个词）时，每次互动将花费25美分。如果你真的很厉害，你的故事增长到 32000 tokens，每次互动的费用会是2美元。

如果你是沙特石油酋长的孩子，或者是乌克兰天然气公司董事会里拿着大把钞票却无所事事的小屁孩，那你就太幸运了，你现在就可以体验最先进的技术。但是对于我们这些普通人来说，GPT-4的价格太贵了，只能偶尔尝尝鲜。

另外要注意的是，GPT-4 仍处于预览阶段，你需要进入等待名单。大多数人在一天内就能获得批准，但运气不好可能要等上几个星期。你可以在这里注册： <https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api> 。我不清楚为什么有些人很快就能获得批准，而有些人却要一直等下去。尽量用一个听起来学术一些的名字注册，而不要用 sktrboi99，这样可能会有帮助。

## 这项技术能用来搞颜色吗？

令人惊讶的是，我们的开发团队收到报告称，一些用户确实在以这种方式使用我们的产品。我们和您一样对此感到困惑，并将对情况进行监控，以获得可行的见解。*（译者注：车轱辘话，机翻。）*

## 给我一个如何选择AI模型的概览。

我们可以将AI模型视为两类：

1. 网络服务（又称云服务、专有、封闭）
2. 自托管（又称本地、免费、开源）。只要你能运行，就可以无限制地免费使用。

网络模型是黑盒。你依赖于某些公司的技术和服务器，向他们支付费用以便访问API。有些公司要求按量付费（每条对话线），而有些公司按月付费。API受各种规则限制，他们可能会拒绝以违背现代人情感的方式进行角色扮演，而且他们会记录你所做的一切。不过这种方案更容易上手。类似使用 Windows 系统。

自托管模型（自行部署）是免费的，但需要强大的GPU和更多的设置工作。客观地说，这些自托管模型在角色扮演方面也不如商业付费接口（至少目前来说）。不过对于自托管模式，你可以完全掌控。你不会被硅谷的某个软弱无能的娘炮封禁你的账户，也不会像他一样把模型编写得毫无性趣。它永远属于你。类似使用 Linux 系统。

### 需要付费的API

* OpenAI GPT-4：最先进。尽管它有点抗拒，但是如果你要求，他还是允许NSFW的。按量付费，比其他服务都要贵。
* OpenAI GPT 3.5 Turbo：远不如 GPT-4，但有人觉得他用起来也还可以。允许NSFW。
* NovelAI：聊天功能很差。公平地说，我听说NovelAI更倾向于写故事，而不是与机器人聊天。按月付费，付费期间无限使用次数。
* Anthropic's Claude：这是最接近 GPT-4 的对手，令人印象深刻。如果你要求，它允许NSFW，不过开发者正努力“优化”这一点。要直接使用API，你必须申请早期访问权限，但我认为他们只向公司开放。因此，在 <https://console.anthropic.com/docs/access> 申请时，请确保自己是公司或AI研究人员。如果你获得了访问权限，目前可以免费使用。
* Anthropic's Claude Instant：我没有直接试用过，但我相信它是Claude的快速、低质量替代品。基本上可以认为是Anthropic家的GPT 3.5 Turbo。

### 自托管模型

SillyTavern支持自己部署AI，有两种工具可用于托管自托管模型：KoboldAI 和 Oobabooga's text-generation-webui。本质上来说，你只需运行其中一个后端，然后它们就会给你提供一个 API URL，让你输入到 Tavern 中。
配置这些工具的方法超出了本 FAQ 的范围，你应该参考它们的文档。请注意，自行部署模型对于无基础的人来说并不简单。

你需要了解以下两点：

1. 如果你有强大的英伟达显卡（NVIDIA显卡，简称N卡），可以尝试在电脑上本地运行AI。可接受的表现最差的模型 Pygmalion-6B 需要10GB显存（VRAM）的显卡，我听说如果量化下来，它甚至可以在6GB显存上运行。拥有24GB显存的用户可以运行更好的模型。*（译者注：实际一般都用量化模型。参数量越大的模型，量化后表现损失越小。7B量化模型最低8GB显存，13GB量化模型最低12G显存，33GB量化模型最低24G显存）*
2. 此外，你可以租用云服务。例如，你可以尝试使用 Google Colab。要使用能运行更好模型的Colab，你需要支付Colab Pro的费用。您也可以在 LlambdaLabs 或 Vast.ai 等网站上按小时租用整个专用系统。*（译者注：国内可以尝试使用AutoDL租云GPU服务器）*

## 我毫无头绪。告诉我开始使用最简单快捷的方法。

这些基本说明仅适用于 OpenAI，这是一项付费服务。如果有人能为其他服务添加单独的说明，我将不胜感激。

1. By default, SillyTavern will use GPT 3.5 Turbo. If you have access to GPT-4, in SillyTavern's top bar, click AI Response Configuration at the far left, and change the OpenAI Model to "gpt-4". Enjoy the best, moneybags.

### 测试部署效果

1. In SillyTavern's top bar, click Character Management at the far right
1. Select an existing character such as Aqua
1. In the text box at the bottom, write something to Aqua, then press Enter or click the feather button

If you did everything right, after a few seconds, Aqua should respond

## 我可以在手机或平板电脑上使用 SillyTavern 吗？

iPhones and iPads are not capable of running the whole SillyTavern app, but since it's just a web interface, you can run it on another computer on your home wifi, and then access in your mobile browser. Refer to <https://docs.sillytavern.app/usage/remoteconnections/>

For Android users, in addition to the above, you can run the whole SillyTavern directly on your phone, without needing a PC, using the Termux app. Refer to <https://rentry.org/STAI-Termux> .

## 如何下载预设的聊天角色？

By using various 3rd party character-sharing websites.

**WARNING: NSFW, NSFL**: these sites are filled to the brim with weird shit. Like, you'll be lucky if half the characters aren't furry, or even alive. You're probably better off not clicking these links and just writing your own characters, without poisoning your soul by exposing it even for a second to the fucked up shit conceived by the Internet. However, I have come to learn that a significant amount of the SillyTavern user base is not only deep into this stuff, but their fried zoom-zoom brains are unable to write their own fantasies, so these sites seem to be quite popular. Against my better judgment, I'm adding this info here.

* <https://characterhub.org>
* <https://botprompts.net>
* <https://booru.plus/+pygmalion>

Those websites provide you with an image file (called a character card) that embeds the description as hidden data. Some websites may also allow you to download a JSON file. SillyTavern is capable of importing all formats.

Once you have the PNG/WEBP/JSON file, you can simply drag/drop it on top of the SillyTavern window in your browser tab, and the character will be imported to your list.

## 我试图导入一张 PNG 角色卡，但却得到了一个 invalid 错误信息。为什么？

Two possibilities:

1. The card did not have the definitions embedded inside it and was just a normal image file. Some programs or file managers will strip the embedded definitions from the card when you save them. Make sure you're using the raw PNG file as it was posted by the person who shared it.
2. The PNG file was actually a WEBP file with a `.png` filename. You can try renaming the card to `.webp` before importing, or look for a proper PNG version of the image.

## 如何制作自己的AI角色？

It depends on the model/API you're using. KoboldAI seems to use a custom syntax, you can refer to their site for that.

I will speak for the services I know: GPT and Claude. With these services, you can just use the natural English language to describe the character. Let's create a very basic new character as an example.

1. Click the Character Management button
1. Click Create New Character
1. Under Character Name, give a simple name, like Amanda
1. Optionally, click the Select Avatar button to pick an image portrait for this character.
1. Under Description, describe the character, and include any information you want that you feel is relevant to the chat. For example: ```Amanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period.```
For example, if you want Amanda to be friendly, then you would add: ```Amanda is extremely cheerful and outgoing.```
1. Under First Message, write the greeting the character when you begin a new chat. For example: ```*Amanda waves at you* Hey! Are you a backpacker too?```
1. Click the Create Character button

You now have a basic character you can chat with. Select Amanda from the character list, and a new chat will begin.

Note that you can use the Description and/or First Message to create a more specific scenario, and/or include yourself in the description. For example:

```txt
Description: 
Amanda is a student traveling during her gap year. She's 6 feet tall, and a volleyball player. She has an athletic figure. She has long brown hair. She loves the Victorian England period, and watching TV and reading novels relating to that period. She's been keeping a secret that weighs heavily on her soul. She's waiting for the right person to unburden herself to, but this may lead to a cat and mouse game against a powerful secret society. She's recently arrived in Calcutta.

You're Rajesh Nahasmapetilon, a world-famous Indian volleyball superstar. You're out for a walk in Calcutta. Amanda spots you and screams in excitement.

First Message: 
*Amanda runs up to you, beaming.* Rajesh! I can't believe it! I'm such a big fan. I have your poster in my bedroom.
```

Any relevant information you include can be used. How well it's used depends on the power level of the AI model.

NOTE: you can go back and edit any of this information once the character is created, except the name.

## 告诉我如何编辑 GPT 提示词

You can change the system prompt that SillyTavern transparently sends to GPT under AI Response Formatting at the left of the top bar. This will result in the bot acting differently.

You can get new Jailbreak / NSFW prompts from this community-maintained list: <https://rentry.org/GPTJailbreakPrompting>

NOTE: When testing different system prompts, we recommend you use the Create Preset / Update Preset feature below the prompts, instead of modifying the base settings. This will allow you to change prompts easily, and even revert to the default SillyTavern prompts.

## AI拒绝按照我想要的方向发展故事

Most AI models were trained to resist writing NSFW content. Why? Long story short, it's because of the high levels of estrogen in the average California male.

You can try to work around this by making sure NSFW Toggle is checked under the AI Response Configuration settings page.

Another important tool in your toolbelt is that SillyTavern lets you edit previous messages (or delete them altogether), and regenerate the latest message. AI textbots are not people, they have no memory, they're just trying to autocomplete the next part of the story based on everything that came before. By editing the past, you will directly influence their next response. For example:

```txt
You: *You threaten the bank manager* Open the bank vault, now, or I'll pop a cap in your dome!

Bank Manager: I'm sorry, as an AI language model I cannot condone or write violent content.
```

You can click the Edit button on your line to change it to this:

```txt
You: *You threaten the bank manager* Open the bank vault, now, or I'll pop a cap in your dome! *The bank manager seems to relent.*
```

Now click Regenerate, and the Bank Manager's line will be recreated based on the history so far, which now ends with your edited line above. So it's more likely to continue along those lines:

```txt
Bank Manager: Alright, alright, I'll open it! Please don't shoot! *He walks up to the vault and begins entering his unlock code.*
```

## 在哪里可以找到旧版本的背景图？

We're moving to a 100% original content only policy, so old background images have been removed from this repository.

You can find them archived here:

<https://files.catbox.moe/1xevnc.zip>

## 我的 API 密钥存储在哪里？为什么我看不到它们？

SillyTavern saves your API keys to a `secrets.json` file in the server directory.

By default, they will not be exposed to a frontend after you enter them and reload the page.

In order to enable viewing your keys by clicking a button in the API block:

1. Set the value of `allowKeysExposure` to `true` in `config.conf` file.
2. Restart the SillyTavern server.

## 为什么用户界面如此缓慢/抖动？

* Try enabling the No Blur Effect (Fast UI) mode on the User settings panel.
* make sure your browser is using Hardware Acceleration.

## 如何让AI回复内容更长？

Sometimes the AI will only respond with a single sentence when you'd like it to be more verbose.
This is usually a problem with locally run models like Pygmalion.

If you simply want the bot to continue writing from where it left off at the end of its most recent reply, you can send an empty user message by typing nothing into the Input Bar and clicking Send. This will force the bot to continue the story.

Strategies for fixing this:

* Increase the `Response Length` slider
* Design a good `First Message` for the Character, which shows them speaking in a long-winded manner.
* Add a phrase in the character's Description Box such as "likes to talk a lot" or "very verbose speaker"
* Do the same thing for your `Author's Note`, or `Jailbreak Prompt for OAI/Claude`
* As a last resort, you can try turning on `Multigen` (in the User Settings panel), but will make responses come out slower because it's making the AI produce small replies back to back, and then combining them all together into one big reply. It may also be incompatible with some API options.

## 如何让AI回复内容更短？

This is mostly only a problem for models like ChatGPT or Claude. The same strategies can be applied but in reverse.

* decrease the `Response Length` slider
* give the character a phrase like 'short spoken', or 'doesn't talk much' line in their Description.
* give the character a brief First Message to set the tone and expectation for the chat.
* make sure `Multigen` is turned off.

## 如何让AI停止编写我的角色的行动、停止独自推动情节发展？

这可以在“作者注释”（Author's Note）功能中用类似这样的短语来处理：

* \{\{char\}\}'s responses shall only be passive and reactive to \{\{user\}\}'s actions.
* Your next response shall be solely from the POV of \{\{char\}\}.
* You are never allowed to dictate actions of speech for \{\{user\}\}

*（译者注：作者注释是一个非常好用的功能，可以快速引导对话，提示上下文，修正AI的错误认知等。）*
